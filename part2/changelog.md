When I run lighthouse on my portfolio site, it gave me a score of 98 for performance, 96 for accessibility, 87 for best practices and 85 for SEO. So, some of the changes I made were:
- Removed src to link fonts that was unnecessary because the fonts needed were downloaded
- Add rel="noopener" for <a> for the links connecting users to GitHub and Linkedin
- Add contents in the <meta> tag
- Changed margins for navigation bar because it is too small of a margin
By changing these aspect in my codes, I was able to end up with a score of 99 for performance, 96 for accessibility, 100 for best practices, and 95 for SEO which improved my portfolio site.
