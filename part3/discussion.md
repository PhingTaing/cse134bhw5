For part3 I planned to do the blogs right above the about me section and added multiples blogs in where the users would only be able to access to edit, add more, or delete after loggin in with Gmail or their personal email and password. In login.js I implemented codes that would allow the users to login with their credentials with login bar. I also implemented post.js for posting, editing and adding blogs onto my portfolio site after signing in. Everything on the firebase end has been implemented.
